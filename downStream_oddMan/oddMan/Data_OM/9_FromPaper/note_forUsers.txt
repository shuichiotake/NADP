[NOTE]
The data files "cat9trmsS.pkl" and "cat9trmsS.txt" for Odd Man in this directory are used in the paper, 
 Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources by Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins,
with some modifications for our experiments.
The former pickle file is created by the latter text file for convinience, and both are essentially equal.

The data file "vocKebds.pkl" is a dictonary data for embeddings of vocabularies used in the above data.
For the embeddings, we use the glove model of 42B.
